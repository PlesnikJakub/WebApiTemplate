## Overview

Setup of a project with proper architecture, guidelines, rules and CI/CD may take a lot of time, days, sometimes even weeks. This repository was created to make that setup easier and faster. 

## Architecture

* This project contain elements of clean code architecture. 
* We do not follow clean code architecture to the smallest details and some elements werent even used.

General rule is that project is build in way we are viling to reuse it in other projects without difficulty of reimplementation.

We are open to any suggestion how to make architecture better :blush:
